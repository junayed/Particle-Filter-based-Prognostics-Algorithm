# Particle Filter based Prognostics Algorithm
This is an attempt of implementing the original paper titled as
 "Prognostics 101: A tutorial for particle filter-based prognostics algorithm using Matlab" (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0951832013000549)
 
 In this paper, the authors implemented all the things by using matlab software. 
 
 To contribute to the open source python community, I have tried to implement the whole thing into python by using a simple basic style which everyone can understand.
 
 
 ## Thank You.
