# Particle Filter based Prognostics Algorithm
This is an attempt of implementing the original paper titled as
 ["Prognostics 101: A tutorial for particle filter-based prognostics algorithm using Matlab"] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0951832013000549)
 
 The original matlab code is available to the website of the author - Dawn An (https://sites.google.com/site/dawnan1114/research/particle-filter-prognostics) titled as Particle Filter Code.
 
 In this paper, the authors implemented all the things by using matlab software. 
 
 To contribute to the open source python community, I have tried to implement the whole thing into python by using a simple basic style which everyone can understand.
 
 The sample dataset is here

 The python implementation is here

 ## Thank You.
